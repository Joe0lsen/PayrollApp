# Overview

This project is a payroll management system.

This program allows the user to add information about employees, such as their title, join date, base salary, and other personal information that can be used to produce a printable payslip.

I decided to take on this project to strengthen my knowledge of the C# language, and the .Net framework. During the course of this project, I also learned a bit of SQL.
